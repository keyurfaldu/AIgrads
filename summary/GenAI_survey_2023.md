**Key Points**

* There are three major directions expected ahead for the focus on GenAI research
    * Architectures like Mixture of Experts, Multimodel Learning
    * Emerging trends like AGI
    * Aligment for ethics, bias mitigation, etc
    * Solving problems like Reducing Hallucination, Misinformation etc
* Mixture of Experts: 
    * Intial direction was laid by switch transformers, and one of the latest is Mistral 8x7B model
    * A gating mechanism is used to leverage only the part of model, or subset of experts. 
* Multimodel learning:
    * Google's Gemini has setup a good benchmark in this. 
* AGI:
    * OpenAI's speculated Q-star algorithm is expected to leverage following:
        * Reinformancement learning (Q-learning) 
        * Path defining approaches like A-star
        * Knowledge, creativity and versatility of LLM
* Alignment: This would see a huge traction to
    * Reduce Hallucination
    * Curtail Misinformation or deep fake detection
    * Bias Mitigation
    * Privacy preservation
    * Etthics and Societal norms

* Some interesting points about what could go redundant and could go as emerging trends
    * RNN, supervised leanring and Finetuning would be redundant for AGI
    * AI Ethics and Human Value Alignemnt would be inherently unresolvable problem as there is a diverse spectrum for human ethics and values.
